**Campaign Programs**

These are programs I built for a campaign in the summer of 2022 to assist with donor reserach and cleaning up the donor database. The programs were generally designed to prioritize code readability over optimization so that future users with less background could adjust functionality as needed.

**donor_res:** scrapes Open Secrets to find potential donors based on given criteria

**dupe_finder:** exports csv with all duplicates found in given csv from donor database

**fec_dupe_finder:** finds duplicates within csv from database and FEC files
